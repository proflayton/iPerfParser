Overall:
  - Not enough bacon being consumed. Increase consumption by at least 146%
    + Fix: Acquired cast iron skillet for cooking more bacon

SpeedTestDataStructure:
  - 

SpeedTestFile:
  - Creation of Individual Speeds Tests (and therefore Ping Threads and Pings)
    might work better when parsing a String rather than a FileStream

IndividualSpeedTest:
  - UDP information needs to be explored and better quantified. What needs
    to be saved?

PingThread:
  - Work on handling of cases where a PingThread was started, but has no Pings.
    i.e. should it be a thread with one Ping, 0.0-1.0 with size and speed of 0?
  - When converting 1 second UDP threads into an array (for SpeedTestFile function
    convertTo_StructureTo2D()), the test has two 0.0-1.0 measurements. How should
    this be handled?
