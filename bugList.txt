Overall:
  - Not enough bacon being consumed. Increase consumption by at least 146%
    + Fix: Acquired cast iron skillet for cooking more bacon

SpeedTestDataStructure:

SpeedTestFile:
  - Creation of Individual Speeds Tests (and therefore Ping Threads and Pings)
    might work better when parsing a String rather than a FileStream
  - Alter structure of array storing Tests (separate by TCP/UDP, E/W)
  - Pass a string of information to IndivSpeedTest, not a stream. What we can do
    is read in the whole of the file (stream.read()), split the string by “\n\n”,
    and then combine elements that are connected (ie. there may be a test that
    has an error, and so the next element in the array has this error info.
    Essentially, we combine the split elements until we hit one that has the
    String “Starting Test” in it)

IndividualSpeedTest:
  - UDP information needs to be explored and better quantified. What needs
    to be saved?
  - Store which order it was (first one = 1, second = 2). Don’t use 
    “Starting Test __”, we don’t want that number. We want which one it was in terms
    of when the test was executed. Was it the first or second one run?
  - getThreadwithNum should work a little differently, like taking a number and direction.
    This function may not be as necessary if we organize IndivTest a little differently

PingThread:
  - Work on handling of cases where a PingThread was started, but has no Pings.
    i.e. should it be a thread with one Ping, 0.0-1.0 with size and speed of 0?
  - When converting 1 second UDP threads into an array (for SpeedTestFile function
    convertTo_StructureTo2D()), the test has two 0.0-1.0 measurements. How should
    this be handled?
